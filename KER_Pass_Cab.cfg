    @description = Some of the accountants were going over the numbers for the Mun missions, and wondered why we needed so many TVs for short drives.  So Bill went and tore out everything from a Crew Cab, and filled it with seats.  It fits a lot more Kerbals now, though there's been some grumbling about a 'sardine can'.
